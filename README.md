# Student-Por# NewsBot Intelligence System 2.0
Advanced NLP Integration and Analysis Platform

## Project Overview
NewsBot Intelligence System 2.0 is a production-ready Natural Language Processing (NLP) platform designed to analyze, understand, and interact with news content in real time. Unlike traditional dataset-driven systems, NewsBot 2.0 processes raw news text input directly, allowing users to paste articles, ask questions, analyze sentiment, extract entities, discover topics, and generate summaries on demand.

This project builds upon the midterm NewsBot foundation and integrates advanced NLP techniques including topic modeling, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, multilingual translation, and conversational AI.

## Key Features
- Multi-level news classification with confidence scoring
- Topic discovery using LDA and NMF
- Sentiment analysis and sentiment evolution
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Automatic text summarization
- Multilingual language detection and translation
- Conversational query interface
- Modular, scalable architecture

## System Architecture
The system is divided into four integrated modules:
- Advanced Content Analysis Engine
- Language Understanding and Generation
- Multilingual Intelligence
- Conversational Interface

## Installation
